Hi I'm Harang Ju, and I research and develop AI agents.

I'm an assistant professor [Johns Hopkins](https://carey.jhu.edu/), a digital fellow at [MIT](https://ide.mit.edu), and an advisor at [Moku](https://twitter.com/Moku_HQ). Previously, I was a postdoc at [MIT](https://ide.mit.edu) and received my PhD in neuroscience at [UPenn](https://www.upenn.edu/).

Outside of work, I enjoy taking [photos](https://www.instagram.com/harangju/). As my personal belief, I affirm the [Nicene Creed](https://www.ccel.org/creeds/nicene.creed.html).
