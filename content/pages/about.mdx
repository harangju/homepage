**I'm Matt Downey, a designer, founder, and entrepreneur.** After scaling my creative agency to seven figures, I now help other digital entrepreneurs grow their businesses efficiently through personalized asynchronous coaching.

I am a postdoc at [MIT](https://ide.mit.edu/people/harang-ju/). I research the sociotechnical impact of Web3 and AI on businesses and society.

I am also building [Tepe](https://tepe.so/) a platform for encrypting, storing, and sharing tokenized content.

I completed my PhD in neuroscience from [UPenn](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/) under Professor [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal/) and my Bachelor's in computer science and cognitive science from UVA.

I recently started learning [photography](https://www.instagram.com/harangju/).
