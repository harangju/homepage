**I'm Harang, a scientist and a builder.**
I explore the sociotechnical impact of Web3 and AI on businesses and society as a postdoc at [MIT](https://ide.mit.edu/), and I am building [Tepe](https://tepe.so/) â€” a platform for encrypting, storing, and sharing tokenized content.

I completed my PhD in neuroscience from UPenn under Professor [Dani Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal/) and my Bachelor's in computer science and cognitive science from UVA.
Here is my complete [CV](</Harang Ju CV.pdf>).
